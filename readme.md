# Agent Yum

Shopping for antibiotic free meat is a challenge. Either you try your luck, or spend a lot of time reading labels. 
gent Yum solves this problem by telling you a lot more about your food. Just snap a photo of a grocery item and Agent Yum
tells you whether there is antibiotic treated meat in that product and much, much more.

You can use it with an Andorid or iOS mobile device or Google Glass.
